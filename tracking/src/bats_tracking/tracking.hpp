//
//  Purpose:
//      - Perform object tracking on a dataset of bats, given segmentation and localization data,
//      - Contains functions used to perform above mentioned task.
//
//  Implementation Details:
//      - Store localization data for all bats in all frames as a nested vector of Vertices.
//      - First approach uses a method that considers localization data for 2 consecutive frames and performs
//          a bipartite matching algorithm to make data associations to identify TRUE object tracks.
//      - Using the found data association, an Alpha-Beta filter is applied to the date to get estimates
//          for the positions of the bats before observing the TRUE measurement.

 *  the vector is indexed by a point using its coordinates (x, y) and the value at the location is a Point describing the previously computed velocity.
 *  in short, it is an efficient way for providing fast storing and lookup across iterations and allowing points in consecutive frames to communicate.
